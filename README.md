# Audiobook (Audible) metadata agent

[![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/seanap/audiobooks.bundle/badge)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/seanap/audiobooks.bundle)
## What is this?
A Plex Metadata Agent for Audiobooks stored in a music library.

This agent sets metadata for your Plex Audiobook library by pulling directly from the internal Audible API. It uses the `Album Artist` file tag as the books Author and uses the `Album Title` file tag as the Book Title. All audio files will need to have these two tags tagged correctly in order for this thing to do its job.

## Differences between Audnexus and Macr0dev's
* The Narrator is mapped to Style.  
* Set's upto 6 meaningfull genres.  
* The series is mapped to Mood, and into AlbumSort tag.  
* Audnexus uses a [database](https://github.com/djdembeck/audnexus) and connects directly to the Audible API
* Audnexus also sets the Author metadata in Plex

This version allows for better filtering and cleaner browsing in plex and various audiobook apps (such as PlexAmp, BookCamp, Prologue), a must have for large libraries. Everything else is the same.

### Tips for greatest success:

* Use mp3tag to auto tag and rename files https://github.com/seanap/Audible.com-Search-by-Album  
* Set "Album" tag in audio file as the book title  
* Set "Artist" tag in audio file as the book author    
* Manual match for both Album and Author can accept ASIN 
* Make sure all the tracks have the same Albumartist and Album, and also have correct Track Number tags.  
* Store each in a folder `%author% \ %series% \ %year% - %album% \ %album% (%year%).m4b`

### Notes:

-Title data in parens ()  such as (Unabridged) is automatically removed before search.

-The first two genre tags show up in the top right when viewing the album/book.  Genre tags are listed in the following order: Genre1, Genre2, Genre3... etc.

-You can filter by the various tags that are added to each book. Be it author, series, narrator, etc.
